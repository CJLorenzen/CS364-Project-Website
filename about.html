      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <a>This goal of this website is to provide an interface to view and filter based primarily on data procured from the Maddison Historical Economic Database. This database is maintained by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre: Faculty of Economics and Business who state their goal is to "provide information on comparative economic growth and income levels over the very long
      run" (Maddison Project Database).</a><br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <a>Our team will primarily acquire data from the Maddison Project Database, as it contains GDP per capita and population data for 170 countries, dating back from hundreds to even thousands of years, depending on the country. The World Bank data base was also used, although this data generally only spans about 50 years. Both databases have a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Compiling the data into a database will allow users to easily analyze long and short term trends of the GDP and populations of 198 countries up until 2018.</a><br><br><br><br><br>
